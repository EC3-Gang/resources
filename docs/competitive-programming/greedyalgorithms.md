# Greedy Algorithms

## Greedy Algorithms explained

Greedy algorithms is not caring about overall optimal solution, but rather the optimal solution in one particular case (boy am i bad at explaining)

Steps of greedy algorithms are

1.  Be lazy
2.  Search some lazy algorithms
3.  Learn greedy algorithms

Basically all you have to do is be lazy

Example:

Theres a tree, try to make the biggest number out of all the elements in the tree. You can assume that all bottom elements are linked to any above element (what am i saying)
Input format:

Line 1: A single interger N ($0$ <= $N$ <= $100$) to determine the number of sub-groups in the tree

Lines 2 - $N+1$: A single interger K ($0$ <= $K$ <= $100$) which is the number of elements in that sub-group of the tree

Output format:

A single interger, which is the biggest sum of each elements in each branch of the tree

Sample input:

    3
    2 4 5
    3 1 2 3 
    2 5 9

Sample output:

    17

This is because I took the biggest elements in each tree and added them together

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  int x[100];
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    int maxi = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < k; ++j) {
      cin >> x[j];
      maxi = max(maxi, x[j]);
    }
    sum += maxi;
    maxi = 0;
  }
  cout << sum;
}
```

Yes. Essentially this code just gets the maximum of each branch and adds them into one collective sum.
